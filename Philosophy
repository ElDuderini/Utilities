When I was reading the book, I was kind of thinking about the philosophy of economics where meaning is attached to pieces of green paper. Why do you think we can give value to something that doesn’t have any inherit value? Why is this value based on debt and is there an objective way to view monetary value?

I’ve also been watching some people argue over semantics and disagreeing over the implications their words have. Makes be wonder how much of the English language is agreed upon by its speakers in terms of the meanings that are attached to those words or tone.
