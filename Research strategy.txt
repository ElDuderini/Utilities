Find example projects for similar things I am trying to do in my own code.
If it is code I am having a hard time understanding, look up documentation on the
what particular methods do.
Watch videos about particular issues that I come across.
Discuss with classmates about how to best tackle a problem if I have been struggling with it for a while.

What I learned:
I feel like my research strategies improved quite a bit over the semester by finding more
specific examples for the problems I wanted to solve, adapting them for my specific uses.
Along with that method, utilizing the official code reference has been extremely useful to learn
the potential of each of the commands that I look into using. Plus the examples provided on there
give me a good idea on how to use the code.

Future ideas:
I feel like trying more experimentation with different methods of coding along with
more uses of varied Unity Engine functions will really help me optimize my code.
An example of this working for me this semester is when I set up the volume slider,
at first using scrollbar instead of a slider with a case/switch system. When I
used the slider instead, the case switch system became redundant and allowed for
much less code to be read, making the program more efficient in both performance
and readability
